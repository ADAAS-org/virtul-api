# VirtulAPI


## Overview

**VirtulAPI** is a powerful library designed to provide enhanced control over the execution of asynchronous tasks. In the realm of VirtulAPI, an asynchronous task refers to a data processing pipeline that traverses seamlessly across microservices, contributing to the completion of a unified global task. The library offers a rich set of components that serve as a solid foundation for extensions, featuring a well-defined class hierarchy rigorously tested in diverse production projects.

## Key Concepts

### Async Task

An **Async Task** represents a unit of work in VirtulAPI, embodying the continuous delegation of data processing across microservices to achieve a larger, overarching objective.

### Connectors

**Connectors** facilitate calls using various protocols, enabling seamless communication between different components and microservices within the VirtulAPI ecosystem.

### Task

A **Task** is a fundamental entity in VirtulAPI, representing the transfer of data between different stages of asynchronous processing.

### Memory

**Memory** serves as a repository for maintaining the state of tasks, ensuring efficient data management throughout the asynchronous task execution.

### Types Converters

**Types Converters** play a crucial role in VirtulAPI, facilitating the conversion of data types between different components, ensuring compatibility and smooth execution.
